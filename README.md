## How does it function

* This add-on injects JavaScript into https://shadertoy.com pages so it can add new UX and features.
* Powered by popular open-source libs [THREE.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [Camera-Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls).
* Under the hood it uses the the THREE.CanvasTexture to easily map the live-rendered shader onto 3D objects.
